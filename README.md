## Day 1: Introduction to Open-Source EDA, OpenLane, and Sky130 PDK

### How to Talk to Computers

In this session, we explored the foundational concepts of communicating with computers, focusing on the architecture and components of integrated circuits.



---

### Introduction to QFN-48 Package, Chip, Pads, Core, Die, and IPs

- **QFN-48 Package**: A surface-mount IC package with 48 pins.
- **Chip Layout**:
  - **Pads**: Points for external connection.
  - **Core**: The heart of the IC where computation happens.
  - **Die**: The silicon wafer that holds the chip.
  - **IPs**: Pre-designed modules integrated into SoCs.

### Introduction to RISC-V

- RISC-V is an open-standard ISA based on reduced instruction set computing principles.
- Enables modular, extensible processor designs for SoCs and embedded applications.

---

### OpenLane and RTL to GDSII Flow

**OpenLane** is an open-source automated digital design flow from RTL to GDSII, integrating tools like Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, Netgen, etc.

- Automates synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, and DRC/LVS checks.
- Uses **Sky130 PDK** for fabrication-compatible design rules.

## LAB : SKY130_D1_SK4 - Synthesis using Yosys

- First, navigate to the design directory:`cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane`.To open the openlane instance:

```bash
docker
# calls the docker instance for the openlane
./flow.tcl -interactive
# opens openlane terminal
package require openlane 0.9
# calls openlane 0.9
prep -design picorv32a
# prepares Picorv32a design for implementation
designs/picorv32a/runs/<run_id>/


run_synthesis
# runs synthesis and abc's
```

<img src="images/openlaneterminal.png" alt="OpenLane Terminal Screenshot" width="800"/>
- In runs/<run_id>/ folder, there's a config.tcl file that shows the actual configuration parameters used during the run, which may differ from the original `designs/picorv32a/config.tcl` file. This allows inspection of what defaults were applied during flow execution.
- After the run is complete, you can inspect the runs directory for output data. The results/ folder contains the synthesized netlist, logs/ stores detailed logs for each stage (like synthesis), and reports/ includes all reports generated during the flow. Among the multiple synthesis reports in reports/synthesis/, the one with the latest timestamp is the most accurate and should be referred to for final results.
  
- To calculate the DFF ratio using the following formula:
FlipFlop Ratio = Number of D Flip Flops / Total Number of Cells
Percentage of DFFs = FlipFlop Ratio * 100
Percentage of DFFs = (1613 / 14876) * 100 = 10.84%
<img src="images/Screenshot 2025-04-09 020049.png" alt="D FF Ratio" width="800"/>
- New files i.e. merged,synthesis are now created in the picorv32a folder

### üóìÔ∏è Day 2: Good FloorPlan Vs Bad FloorPlan and Introduction to Library Cells

- Compared effective vs poor floorplans
- Studied standard cells (inverter, buffer, etc.)
- Gained hands-on experience with floorplanning in OpenLane
  

### üî≤ Preplaced Cells Concept
- The top-level logic is divided into smaller cuts or blocks, which are implemented separately.
- Some parts of the circuit are designed in a reusable, black-boxed format ‚Äî often used multiple times like an IP block.
- Examples include memory blocks, complex clock gating, muxes, comparators, ALUs, etc.
- These blocks are placed and fixed **before** the standard cell placement. Tools do not alter their positions during placement.
- These are called **pre-placed cells**, and must be surrounded with **decoupling cells** to maintain voltage integrity.

### ‚ö° Decoupling Cells
- Help maintain stable supply voltage near pre-placed logic blocks.
- Mitigate voltage drops caused by resistance in the power delivery path.
- Act like capacitors that release charge during voltage dips.

### üîå Power (PWR) Planning
- If there's only one power supply point, the voltage drop can cause **signal integrity issues**.
- To mitigate this, **power mesh grids** are spread across the chip to ensure minimal distance from power to logic.

### üìç Pin Placement
- Requires knowledge of how input/output pins will interact with internal logic.
- Affects routing congestion and final performance of the chip.
